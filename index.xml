Although analysis-synthesis based on signal processing can be controlled using acoustic parameters, its speech quality is inferior to that of neural vocoders.
This paper proposes End-to-End Neural Formant Synthesis for generating high-quality speech waveforms with controllable acoustic parameters from low-dimensional representations. We compared three models with different structures, and investigated their synthesis quality and controllability.</description></item></channel></rss>
